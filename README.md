# bci_project
My solution for "web application API which primary function is to serve as a platform for selling and buying used item" graded exercise. Course Building Cloud Integration, spring 2021.

OpenAPI documents (made with Stoplight & Postman) can be found from folder "models", and also from file "bci project Miina.postman_collection.json" (latter is not as comprehensive as the one's in /models/)

Project is running on: https://bci-miina-project.herokuapp.com/
